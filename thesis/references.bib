  abstract        = "The Hindley/Milner type system has been widely adopted as a
                  basis for statically typed functional languages. One of the
                  main reasons for this is that it provides an elegant
                  compromise between flexibility, allowing a single value to be
                  used in different ways, and practicality, freeing the
                  programmer from the need to supply explicit type information.
                  Focusing on practical applications rather than implementation
                  or theoretical details, these notes examine a range of
                  extensions that provide more flexible type systems while
                  retaining many of the properties that have made the original
                  Hindley/Milner system so popular. The topics discussed, some
                  old, but most quite recent, include higher-order polymorphism
                  and type and constructor class overloading. Particular
                  emphasis is placed on the use of these features to promote
                  modularity and reusability.",
